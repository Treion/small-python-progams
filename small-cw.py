# Ex: 1
# A loop that will print 1-10

# for x in range(1,11):
#         print(x)

# Ex: 2

# for x in range(2,21,2):
#         print(x)

# Ex: 3

# for x in range(1,11):
#         print(x*x)

# Ex: 4

# sum = 0
# for x in range(11)
#     sum = sum + x
# print(sum)

# Bonus Ex

# for x in range(0,(7*11),7):
#     print(x)

# for i in range(1,11,2):
#     print(i*7)

# Ex: 7

# for x in range(10,0,-1):
#     print(x)

# Ex: 9

# product = 1
# for num in range(5,0,-1):
#     product = product*num
# print(product)
